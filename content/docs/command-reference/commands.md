## User Terminal

![](images/docs/cmd-toolbar.png)

The Bus Pirate is accessed from a command line in a serial terminal. Use your
terminal of choice. On Windows we like the latest version of [Tera
Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

TIP

Talk to the Bus Pirate from a serial terminal of your choice set to 115200bps,
8/N/1. The serial port is emulated over USB, so higher bitrate (bps) settings
will also work with no extra configuration. If the user interface feels slow,
check that the speed is at least 115200bps.
